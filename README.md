# BlogHub (Django) — FBV vs CBV

A Django Blog web app built twice to compare **Function-Based Views (FBV)** and **Class-Based Views (CBV)**.
The two projects implement the *same features and UI* to highlight differences in structure, reusability, and scalability.

## ✨ Features
- User authentication (signup / login / logout)
- Blog posts: list + details
- Categories filtering
- Create / Update / Delete posts (authenticated users)
- Bootstrap-based UI
- Django Admin panel

## 🧰 Tech Stack
- Python
- Django
- SQLite (dev)
- HTML / Bootstrap (templates)
